### About

Machine Learning models for molecules and materials are essential drivers in drug discovery, materials design, environmental science, and precision medicine. With these models, experts are enabled to meaningfully interact with molecular systems and to design them. The interaction with molecular systems allows for deeper insights into typically complex systems and facilitate (enable) the development of new drugs, personalized medical treatments, and innovative materials - e.g., advanced fuel cells in the field of energy conversion and storage or materials for environmental remediation in the field of environmental science. Recently, large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains in machine learning, revolutionizing natural language processing tasks and showing notable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. LLMs have also had a profound impact on molecular machine learning because they allow for human-AI interaction, interpretability, zero- and few-shot adaption, and in-context learning. However, the application of LLM architectures to molecular data presents significant challenges. Therefore, this workshop focuses on exploring potentials of ML methods with broader capabilities like LLMs incorporate them. We welcome all work which might provide potential steps towards these broader capabilities, e.g., by tackling the areas of knowledge and interaction, adaptability and robustness, abstraction and reasoning, or efficiency.

Join us at our workshop at which experts from diverse fields, ranging from ML and LLMs to molecular sciences, will collaborate to explore new potentials of ML methods for molecules and materials  in the era of LLMs.
